# Aqueduct Spark Guide

Single reference for Spark behavior in Aqueduct — covers both blueprint authoring
(compiler warnings, cost model) and internal implementation rules (contributor rules,
pitfalls, transformation reference).

---

## For Blueprint Authors

### Compiler Warnings

Every warning links to an anchor here. Warnings are informational unless marked **[ERROR]**.

#### `probe-sample-cost`

**Triggered when:** A Probe has a signal of type `null_rates`, `row_count_estimate`
(sample method), `value_distribution`, or `distinct_count`.

`df.sample(fraction)` is a **row-level random filter**, not a partition prune.
Every row in every partition is read before the random filter is applied — Spark
cannot skip partitions because it doesn't know which rows pass until it reads them.

A `null_rates` probe with `fraction: 0.01` on a 10 TB dataset reads all 10 TB.
Only the output is 1% of rows; the I/O cost is 100%.

**Zero-cost alternatives:**

| Signal | Zero-cost method |
|---|---|
| `row_count_estimate` | `method: spark_listener` — reads from `obs.db`, no Spark action |
| `schema_snapshot` | Always zero-action |
| `partition_stats` | `df.rdd.getNumPartitions()` — zero action |

**To silence:** If you accept the cost, add `block_full_actions: false` explicitly in
the Probe config to document intent.

**Future:** File-level sampling (random subset of Parquet/Delta files via file
statistics) would make these signals genuinely cheap. Not yet implemented.

#### `incremental-watermark-scan`

**Triggered when:** A Channel has `materialize: incremental` and no `Checkpoint`
upstream.

After each incremental run Aqueduct advances the watermark via:

```python
df.agg(F.max(watermark_column)).collect()
```

This is an extra Spark action. If the DataFrame is not cached, Spark re-executes
the full DAG — a second scan of the output data. On large outputs (hundreds of GB)
this doubles the incremental step's reading cost.

**Mitigations:**
1. Add a `Checkpoint` upstream — materializes the DataFrame so subsequent actions
   read from checkpoint, not recompute the DAG.
2. Cache the Channel output upstream of the egress.
3. Accept the cost for small/medium datasets.

**Future:** Track watermark max as a side-effect of the write phase to eliminate
the extra action entirely.

---

#### `python-udf-performance`

**Triggered when:** A UDF in `udf_registry` has `lang: python` (the default).

Python UDFs execute **row-at-a-time** in the Python interpreter and bypass
Arrow-optimized (vectorized) execution entirely:

- Each row crosses the JVM↔Python serialization boundary
- No Arrow batch transfer, no SIMD/columnar processing
- For billions of rows: **10–100× slower** than a native Spark SQL expression

**The spillway is unaffected.** Spillway routing uses SQL `filter()` — fully
vectorized. The concern is the UDF body, not the error-routing mechanism.

**Alternatives:**

| Option | When to use |
|---|---|
| Native Spark SQL (`try_cast`, `try_divide`, `coalesce`, etc.) | Preferred — vectorized, zero overhead |
| `pandas_udf` with Arrow | Complex Python logic; batched via Arrow, much faster |
| `lang: java` | Maximum performance required |

---

#### `delivery-semantics-append-retry`

**Triggered when:** `retry_policy.max_attempts > 1` and any Egress uses `mode: append`.

Retries on an `append`-mode Egress produce duplicate rows — the failed run already
wrote some data before the failure. `mode: overwrite` is idempotent; `mode: append`
is not.

**Fix:** Use `mode: overwrite` for retried pipelines, or `max_attempts: 1` with
orchestrator-level retry handling.

### Probe Signal Cost Model

| Signal / Operation | I/O Cost | Spark Actions | Blocked by `block_full_actions` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `schema_snapshot` | Zero | 0 | No |
| `partition_stats` | Zero | 0 | No |
| `row_count_estimate` (spark_listener) | Zero | 0 | No |
| `sample_rows` | First partition(s) only | 1 (`limit.collect`) | No |
| `row_count_estimate` (sample) | **Full scan** | 1 | Yes |
| `null_rates` | **Full scan** | 2 | Yes |
| `value_distribution` | **Full scan** | 1 | Yes |
| `distinct_count` | **Full scan** | 1 | Yes |
| `data_freshness` (fraction=0 default) | **Full scan** | 1 | Yes |
| Incremental watermark `MAX()` | Full scan of output (if uncached) | 1 | No |
| Assert aggregate rules | Full scan | 1 (batched `agg`) | — |
| Assert `spillway_rate` | Full scan × 2 | 2 extra | — |

### SparkListener Row Estimates — Stage Fusion Caveat

The `row_count_estimate` signal with `method: spark_listener` queries `module_metrics`
in `obs.db` using the module's ID as the lookup key. This works correctly when each
logical module maps to its own Spark stage.

**Edge case — stage fusion:** Spark's Catalyst optimizer can fuse multiple logical
modules (Channel → Egress, or multiple narrow transforms) into a single physical stage.
When this happens, `recordsWritten` from the fused stage is attributed to one stage ID
and the per-module breakdown may not be available or may reflect the combined output
of multiple logical modules.

**Consequence:** The row estimate for a Channel that was fused with its downstream
Egress may show the Egress's written count, not the Channel's intermediate row count.
The estimate is still useful for capacity planning but should not be treated as exact
for per-module cost attribution.

**No fix required** — this is a Spark optimizer behavior. The caveat is noted here
so users understand why estimates occasionally differ from expected counts.

### `@aq.secret()` — Environment Variable Resolution Only

`@aq.secret(KEY)` resolves exclusively via `os.environ.get(KEY)` at compile time
(before SparkSession creation). There is no external secrets provider integration
(no Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or GCP Secret Manager client).

**What this means:**
- Secrets must be injected into the process environment before `aqueduct` is invoked
- In Kubernetes: use `envFrom` with a Secret resource, or a Vault agent sidecar
- In YARN/EMR: export variables in the driver bootstrap script
- Secrets needed for SparkSession config (e.g. Databricks tokens, S3 credentials)
  must also be in `os.environ` — they resolve at compile time and are embedded in
  the Manifest's `spark_config` before the session is created

**Error message:** If the variable is not set, Aqueduct raises immediately with a
clear message — it does not fall back silently to an empty string.

### Planned Future Checks

Not yet implemented — planned for future compiler passes:

- **Partition count advisory:** Warn when an Ingress path has many small files;
  suggest `coalesce` or `repartition`.
- **Skew detection:** Compare partition sizes from SparkListener metrics after a run;
  warn when max/median ratio exceeds threshold.
- **Egress format advisory:** Warn when writing to CSV without explicit schema —
  downstream readers trigger schema inference (full scan).
- **High-fanout Junction:** Warn when a Junction has many inputs without a broadcast
  hint, suggesting potential shuffle overhead.
- **Watermark column type:** Warn when `watermark_column` is a string type —
  `MAX()` on strings is lexicographic, not temporal.
- **Partition suggestion:** Based on source file count and size statistics, recommend
  `repartition(n)` value at compile time.
- **Delta small-file advisory:** Warn when an Egress uses `format: delta` with
  `mode: append` or `mode: merge` and no external OPTIMIZE job is referenced —
  incremental Delta writes accumulate small files without OPTIMIZE.

## For Contributors

Read this section before modifying any Executor module or implementing new Channel
operations. Rules here are enforced by code review.

### Core Spark Principles

- **Lazy evaluation:** DataFrames are immutable execution plans. No computation
  until an action (`.write`, `.count`, `.collect`).
- **Narrow vs wide transformations:** Narrow (`filter`, `map`) keep data in
  partitions. Wide (`groupBy`, `join`, `distinct`) cause shuffles — expensive on
  large datasets.
- **Predicate pushdown:** Spark pushes filters to the source when using SQL or
  DataFrame expressions. Use `spark.sql()` or `expr()` to leverage this; avoid
  Python-side filtering that breaks the pushdown chain.

### Implementation Rules (DO NOT VIOLATE)

**1. Never add Spark actions in the critical execution path.**

Probes: use `SparkListener` (zero-cost) or explicit `.sample()` guarded by
`block_full_actions`. Never call `.count()`, `.collect()`, or `.show()` on the
main DataFrame inside the execution loop.

**2. Performance-degrading actions require explicit user opt-in.**

Any `df.count()`, `df.collect()`, or extra scan added for observability MUST be:
- Gated behind a named flag in `aqueduct.yml` under the `metrics:` section
- Default `false` (zero-cost production mode)
- Accompanied by a visible `click.echo()` warning at run start when enabled —
  naming the flag, the cost, and instructing the user to disable in production

No silent performance degradation. Ever.

**3. Use SQL expressions over Python UDFs.**

Python UDFs force row-by-row JVM↔Python serialization. LLM patches must favor
SQL `CASE`, `RLIKE`, and built-in functions. When a UDF is unavoidable, use
`pandas_udf` (Arrow-batched).

**4. Spillway routing is SQL-native — keep it that way.**

Spillway uses `df.filter(spillway_condition)` + `withColumn(F.lit(...))` for
`_aq_error_*` columns. Both are pure Spark SQL — vectorized, no Python boundary.
Do not introduce Python-side row iteration into the spillway path.

**5. Validate `schema_hint` explicitly.**

Spark's `nullable=false` is advisory only — not enforced at runtime. Ingress must
compare `df.schema` against the hint and raise `IngressError` on mismatch.

**6. Union by name, not position.**

Funnel `union_all` uses `unionByName(allowMissingColumns=True)` in permissive mode.
Never use positional `union()` — column order is not guaranteed across sources.

**7. Avoid unintentional shuffles.**

- Junction uses `filter` (narrow — no shuffle)
- Funnel `union_all` is narrow; `union` (distinct) is wide
- Check `df.explain()` in tests when touching join or aggregation paths

### Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| `sample()` looks cheap but reads all data | Document as full scan; gate behind `block_full_actions` |
| `coalesce` can create skewed partitions | Prefer `repartition` for balanced output; document tradeoff when using `coalesce` |
| Date parsing returns `null` on failure silently | `schema_hint` catches type mismatches; validate formats in SQL with `try_cast` |
| Python UDFs cause memory contention under GC pressure | Discourage; use SQL built-ins or `pandas_udf` |
| Catalyst chooses suboptimal join strategy on small tables | Expose `spark_config` overrides (`spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold`) — do not force hints in Aqueduct code |
| `watermark_column` is a string type | `MAX()` is lexicographic on strings — warn at compile time (planned) |
| Incremental `MAX()` rescans output | Instruct users to add Checkpoint or cache; tracked in `incremental-watermark-scan` warning |

### Transformation Reference

| Operation | Narrow / Wide | Shuffle? |
|---|---|---|
| `filter`, `select`, `withColumn` | Narrow | No |
| `unionByName` | Narrow | No |
| `coalesce` | Narrow | No (but may cause skew) |
| `distinct` | Wide | Yes |
| `groupBy`, `agg` | Wide | Yes |
| `join` | Wide | Yes (unless broadcast) |
| `repartition` | Wide | Yes |
| `sample` | Narrow | No (but reads all rows) |
| `limit` + `collect` | Narrow | No (stops after first N rows from first partition(s)) |
