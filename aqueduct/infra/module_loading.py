"""User-code module loading — the ONE way to import Blueprint-referenced code.

Any feature that imports **user-authored** code from a Blueprint/config
reference (a dotted ``fn:``, a ``module:`` + ``entry:`` pointer, a
``module.Class`` path) must resolve it through :func:`load_module` /
:func:`load_callable` with the manifest's ``base_dir`` — never a bare
``importlib.import_module``. Bare imports only search ``sys.path``, and the
``aqueduct`` console script never has the blueprint's directory there — a
sibling ``.py`` next to the blueprint is invisible. This exact bug shipped
independently 5 times (secrets resolver, custom Assert, custom Probe pointer,
python UDF, custom DataSource) before being fixed once here.

When ``base_dir`` is given and ``<base_dir>/<module/path>.py`` exists, the
module is loaded directly from that file via
``importlib.util.spec_from_file_location`` and is never registered in
``sys.modules`` — this makes it immune to colliding with an unrelated module
of the same name already loaded elsewhere in the process (e.g. a resolver
package named ``secrets`` colliding with the stdlib ``secrets`` module). The
module is re-loaded on every call (no caching) — a nice side effect is that
editing the file takes effect on the next call with no restart.

Caveat: the file-path load only covers a single flat file. If the loaded
module itself does a relative (``from . import x``) or sibling-package
import, that inner import still goes through the normal ``sys.path``-based
import system and is not covered by this collision-proofing — keep custom
callables self-contained in one file.

When ``base_dir`` is not set, or no file exists at the derived path (e.g. the
path names an installed package, or a module already reachable via
``sys.path``), falls back to the normal ``importlib.import_module`` —
``base_dir`` is passed unconditionally by callers (config/blueprint
directory), so this must stay a fallback, not a hard requirement, for
callables that aren't a file sitting next to the blueprint.

Pure stdlib (``importlib`` + ``pathlib``) — no pyspark, no domain imports.
``executor/probe_plugins.py`` (pyspark-free by charter) is a consumer.
